This project, based on a challenge from Frontend Mentor, showcases a responsive recipe page designed using modern CSS techniques and SCSS. The focus was on utilizing viewport units and enhancing responsive design skills.

## What I Learned

- **Viewport Units**: I used `rem` for font sizes and `em` for padding and margins, improving the scalability and accessibility of the design.
- **SCSS**: I gained experience in using SCSS for more efficient and organized styling.
- **Responsive Design**: I significantly improved my understanding and application of responsive web design principles.
